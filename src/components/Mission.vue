        Client-centred learning is an approach to learning to drive that takes into account how you prefer to learn. When people learn in this way they are more likely to retain information and skills.
        We’re well aware that people learn in different ways and at very different speeds. If someone who likes time to reflect on their learning is forced to move on to the next thing too quickly it could slow down their overall progress.
        Another example is if someone who likes to learn by trying things out is made to watch too many demonstrations without having a go they are likely to get frustrated and not enjoy their lessons.
        Learners are also more likely to keep learning if they are encouraged to take responsibility for their learning at an early stage – this is the second aim of client-centred learning (CCL). This way, it is theirs, is their conclusion and is therefore likely to stick with the learner for life, way beyond just passing the driving test.
        Learner drivers in Stoke-on-Trent  transfer to our driving school because their instructor can’t fit them in. We’re serious about helping you learn to drive and so don’t book you in unless we know that there is a weekly slot ongoing until you pass your test.
        For us, teaching someone to drive is not just about passing their test. Sure, we properly prepare you and ensure you know everything in order to get that first time pass. Importantly we ensure that you can drive independently, skilfully and efficiently as part of our service.
        Customers of Go2 Driving School will be able to drive independently in a variety of road and traffic conditions. We aim to ensure that you <strong>WILL</strong> understand what you are doing and most importantly, <strong>WHY.</strong></p>
